							<h3>Testimonials</h3>
							<!-- Requirement: Scroll box-->
							<div class="scrollBox">
								“The service provided by Sunrise has been excellent throughout this project. Their project delivery programme was well thought out and integrated seamlessly with our own operation and was delivered on time with professionalism and attention to detail. It is important for us to partner with like-minded businesses and for them to be able to work alongside us delivering on the needs and vision of Manufacture Co.”</br></br>
								Manufacture Co | Greenville, NC, USA | Mark Williams (Director of Technical Services)</br></br></br>
								“Sunrise worked hard before the project to come up with a solution that met our requirements. The county was keen to have PV as a showcase for renewable energy technologies and we were really pleased that they helped us find a solution which enabled this installation to run smoothly. The team was helpful and efficient throughout the install and they also commissioned a display that informs the young people visiting us about the energy savings to improve their understanding of sustainability – this is just as important as the financial savings to the county’s budget.”</br></br>
								Norfolk County Council | Norfolk County, UK | Rob Fisher (Head of Sustainability)</br></br></br>
								“Working with Sunrise on our 3rd Solar project was a great success and they have a good team of people right from when the initial consultation starts, through the design process, project sign off and installation on site. I would be more than happy to work with Sunrise again on another project in the near future.”</br></br>
								Oregon State University | Corvallis, OR, USA | Lisa Schwab (Facilities Manager)
